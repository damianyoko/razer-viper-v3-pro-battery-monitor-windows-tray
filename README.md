A tiny system tray battery indicator for the **Razer Viper V3 Pro** wireless mouse. No Razer Synapse, no kernel drivers, no admin required. ~9 MB resident, single-file `.exe`.

  <sub><em>First interaction: left-click → popup with the percentage. Second: hover → native tooltip.</em></sub>
</p>

## Why

Synapse is bloatware. It runs multiple services, installs kernel-mode drivers, and phones home — just to show you a battery percentage. This tool does the same job in a 213 KB binary that uses ~9 MB of RAM and talks directly to the mouse over standard HID feature reports.

### Footprint comparison

Razer's currently-recommended client is **Synapse 4** (modular installer, Mouse module only).

| | **Viper Tray** (this) | Razer Synapse 4 |
|---|---|---|
| Disk install | **213 KB** | ~250 MB – 1 GB (varies with modules; +Chroma adds more) |
| RAM at idle | **~9 MB** | ~150–350 MB across `Razer Synapse Service`, `RazerAppEngine`, helpers |
| Background services | None | Multiple user-mode services, autostart |
| Kernel drivers | None | `RzCommon.sys`, `RzDev_*.sys` (per-device) |
| Admin required | No | Yes (installer) |
| Network calls | None | Yes (telemetry, updates, account) |
| Tells you the battery % | Yes | Yes |

If the only thing you use Synapse for is checking your mouse battery, this does the same job at roughly 1/30th the RAM and a fraction of a percent of the disk footprint.

## What you get

- A horizontal battery icon in the system tray, colour-coded:
  - **Green** ≥ 60%
  - **Orange** 20–60%
  - **Red** < 20%
- **Left-click** → small popup near cursor showing the percentage. Click again to dismiss.
- **Right-click** → menu: *Refresh now* / *Exit*.
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes (system-coalesced waitable timer; battery-friendly on laptops).
- Single-instance guard via named mutex — clicking the icon twice doesn't stack trays.
- Survives reboots once installed.

## Install

### Easy: pre-built binary (recommended)

1. Download `viper-tray-vX.Y.Z.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/damianyoko/viper-tray/releases/latest).
2. Extract anywhere stable (e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\Tools\RazerBattery\`).
3. From an unprivileged PowerShell prompt in that folder:
   ```powershell
   .\install.ps1
   ```
   Adds an `HKCU\…\Run` entry and launches the tray immediately.

### From source (requires Rust toolchain)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/damianyoko/viper-tray
cd viper-tray\rust
cargo build --release
copy target\release\viper-tray.exe ..\
cd ..
.\install.ps1
```

### PowerShell-only fallback

If you don't want to download a binary or build Rust, the original PowerShell implementation is still in this repo (`razer-battery.ps1` + `start-hidden.vbs`). The installer will use it if no `.exe` is present. ~125 MB RAM though.

## Uninstall

```powershell
.\uninstall.ps1
```
Removes the autostart entry and stops any running instance.

## How it works

The Viper V3 Pro exposes its mouse HID interface (UsagePage `0x01`, Usage `0x02`) on the dongle (VID `0x1532`, PID `0x00C0` / `0x00C1`). Razer's command protocol piggybacks on that interface as a 90-byte feature report.

The binary:
1. Enumerates HID device interfaces via SetupAPI for VID `0x1532`
2. Opens each candidate with `dwDesiredAccess = 0` to bypass `mouclass`'s exclusive lock (mice can't be opened with read/write while in use, but feature-report-only access works)
3. Filters for the mouse collection (UP=1, Usage=2, FeatureReportByteLength ≥ 91)
4. Sends a Razer feature report: `command_class = 0x07`, `command_id = 0x80` (get battery level), transaction ID `0x1F`
5. Reads the response; battery byte is `arguments[1]` (offset 10), scaled `0–255 → 0–100%`

Protocol details from the [OpenRazer](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer) project.

## Why it only works for Viper V3 Pro

The PID filter and transaction ID are hard-coded for this mouse. Other Razer mice use different PIDs and some older ones use TID `0x3F`. If you have a different Razer mouse, [xzeldon/razer-battery-report](https://github.com/xzeldon/razer-battery-report) supports more devices.

## Troubleshooting

**The icon doesn't appear** — Windows hides new tray icons by default. Click the `^` arrow in your taskbar and drag the battery icon out into the always-visible area.

**It shows `?` (offline)** — your dongle isn't connected, or the mouse is asleep. Move the mouse and click *Refresh now*. If it stays offline, unplug and replug the dongle.

**Two icons appear on boot** — duplicate Run entries. Run `.\uninstall.ps1` then `.\install.ps1` to reset cleanly.

**Antivirus complains** — the binary is unsigned. Submit a false-positive report or whitelist it; the source is right here for verification.
